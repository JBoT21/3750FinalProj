            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This proposal outlines the development of a web application for our final project
                that aims to solve specific problems faced by users. The application will be designed 
                with user experience in mind, ensuring that it is intuitive and easy to navigate.
                It is a demonstration of our skills that we learned in the course of
                CPSC 3750: Web App Development.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The objective of this web application is to design a simple web app that combines the 
                skills that we learned over the course of the semester that is functional, efficient, and 
                easy to use. The app will be a simple store that makes use of a database to store different 
                items and their prices.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                The app will allow users to add items and view them in their cart as 
                well as calculate the total price of their items and proceede to enable the patrons to purchase 
                their items. The app will also be able to manipulate a database that reflects the changes when 
                items are purchased or when stock increases. (Extra): The app will able to make API calls to 
                a golf course API to get information on golf courses and their prices.
            </ul>
