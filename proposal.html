            <h3>
                This proposal outlines the development of a web application for our final project
                that aims to solve specific problems faced by users. The application will be designed 
                with user experience in mind, ensuring that it is intuitive and easy to navigate.
                It is a demonstration of our skills that we learned in the course of
                CPSC 3750: Web App Development.

            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <h3>
                The objective of this web application is to design a simple web app that combines the 
                skills that we learned over the course of the semester that is functional, efficient, and 
                easy to use. The app will be a simple store that makes use of a database to store different 
                items and their prices. It will be called Golfly (pronounced as: Golf-LEE) and will be a simple store
                for all your golfing needs!

        <section>
            <h1>Features</h1>
            <h3>
                The app will enable users to add and remove items from their cart, view their selections, 
                and see the total cost in real time. It will also provide functionality for completing purchases.
                On the backend, the app will interact with a database to update inventory based on purchases or restocks.
                <br><br> 
                (Extra Feature): The app will also be capable of making API calls to a golf course data provider, allowing users 
                to browse golf courses and view their pricing information.
